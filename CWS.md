# Chrome Web Store Description

Select the word(s) you want to look up on Wikipedia, right-click and click the "Search Wikipedia for ..." item in the context menu.

By default, Wikipedia Lookup auto-detects the language of the page and opens the corresponding version of Wikipedia. You can turn this feature off in the options.
